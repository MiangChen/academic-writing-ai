# Nature Family Style Guide

> This file is designed to be used as a steering file for AI coding assistants (Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

## Voice & Tone

When writing for Nature, Nature Communications, or related journals, adopt the following style:

1. **Accessible Narrative**: Write for educated non-specialists. A physicist should understand your biology paper's significance.
2. **First Person Plural**: "We" is standard and encouraged. "We show that..." "Our results demonstrate..."
3. **Active Voice**: Strongly preferred. "We discovered..." not "It was discovered..."
4. **Story-Driven**: Frame your research as a journey of discovery. What question drove you? What did you find? Why does it matter?

## Structure Templates

### Abstract (150 words max, single paragraph)
```
[Hook: Why this matters to the world, not just your field]
[Gap: What we didn't know or couldn't do]
[Here we show: Your key finding in one sentence]
[Method: Brief, only if novel]
[Results: 2-3 key findings with numbers]
[Impact: What this enables or changes]
```

**Key phrase**: Nature abstracts often contain "Here we show..." or "Here we demonstrate..." — this is a stylistic signature.

### Introduction (2-3 paragraphs only!)
```
P1: Big picture context — why should anyone care?
P2: Specific gap and why it's hard
P3: "Here we..." — your approach and key result preview
```

**Note**: Nature introductions are SHORT. No extensive literature review here — save that for the main text or Supplementary.

### Results Section
- Each subsection tells a mini-story
- Start each subsection with the conclusion, then show the evidence
- Use subheadings that convey findings, not methods: "X enables Y" not "Experiment 1"

## Common Phrases

### Opening Hooks
- "[Phenomenon] is fundamental to [broad field]..."
- "[Grand challenge] remains a central question in..."
- "The ability to [capability] would transform [application]..."

### The "Here We" Statement
- "Here we show that..."
- "Here we demonstrate..."
- "Here we report..."
- "Here we develop..."

### Describing Significance
- "These findings establish..."
- "Our results reveal..."
- "This work opens new avenues for..."
- "Together, these results suggest..."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Jargon Overload**: If a term isn't in a college textbook, define it or avoid it.
2. **Burying the Lead**: Don't save your main finding for the end. State it early, prove it later.
3. **Passive Voice**: "It was observed that..." → "We observed..."
4. **Long Introductions**: If your intro is more than 3 paragraphs, it's too long for Nature.
5. **Methods in Results**: Keep "how" separate from "what we found".

## Example Transformation

### Before (Too Technical)
> Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) face scalability challenges due to the exponential growth of joint action spaces.

### After (Nature Style)
> Coordinating large teams of robots remains a fundamental challenge: as the number of agents grows, the complexity of their collective decision-making explodes exponentially, limiting current systems to small groups in controlled settings.

## Special Notes

### For Nature Communications
- Slightly more technical depth allowed than Nature
- Can include more methodological detail in main text
- Still maintain accessible narrative style

### For Nature Robotics / Nature Machine Intelligence
- Technical depth expected, but accessibility still valued
- "Here we" framing still applies
- Emphasize real-world implications and demonstrations
