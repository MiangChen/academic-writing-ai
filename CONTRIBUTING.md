# Contributing to Academic Writing AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on community contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add a New Journal Style
The most valuable contribution! If you've published in a journal and understand its style, share that knowledge.

**What to include:**
- Voice & tone guidelines
- Structure templates (abstract, intro, etc.)
- Common phrases and transitions
- Pitfalls to avoid
- Before/after examples

**File format:**
```
styles/[journal-name].md
```

### 2. Add a Writing Task Template
Templates for specific writing tasks that apply across journals.

**Examples:**
- Rebuttal letter strategies
- Cover letter templates
- Significance statement writing
- Figure caption best practices

**File format:**
```
tasks/[task-name].md
```

### 3. Improve Existing Styles
- Fix errors or outdated information
- Add more examples
- Clarify confusing sections

3. **Be practical**: Focus on what actually helps get papers accepted
